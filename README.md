## What Nova Does For You

**📬 Acts on your behalf**
Sends emails, posts to X and LinkedIn, makes phone calls, books calendar events, and follows up with contacts. Nova takes action. You just ask.

**🧠 Learns who you are**
Your voice, contacts, preferences, and working style. The more you use it, the more Nova thinks and writes like you.

**🔐 Stays on your server**
Zero third-party data sharing. No monthly SaaS fee. You own the infrastructure, the data, and every line of code.

---

## How It Works

1. **Set up in minutes.** Clone the repo, add your API keys, run one command.
2. **Connect your tools.** Link email, calendar, Telegram, X, LinkedIn, and your phone number.
3. **Just tell Nova what you need.** Message it on Telegram like a trusted assistant. It acts and reports back.

---

## Built for Solo Founders

You are wearing every hat. Nova gives you leverage without adding headcount.

- Drafts and sends cold emails while you sleep
- Researches competitors and delivers a briefing before your first meeting
- Posts to X and LinkedIn from a single message to Nova
- Remembers every contact, follow-up, and unfinished thread so you never drop the ball

Nova is a fully autonomous Non-Human Assistant you run on your own server. It connects to you via Telegram (and optionally voice, email, WhatsApp, and X), builds a persistent memory of who you are, and can take real-world actions on your behalf — from writing emails to making phone calls to researching the web.

Unlike SaaS assistants, Nova runs entirely on infrastructure you own. Your data stays on your server.

## 🎯 Nova's Purpose

> *Nova exists to be the proactive half of your intelligence — noticing what you'd notice if you had infinite time, acting on what needs doing before you ask, and learning enough about you to anticipate rather than just respond.*

Nova's purpose drives five proactive behaviors, all within security guardrails:

| Drive | When | What Nova does |
|---|---|---|
| ☀️ **Morning briefing** | 7:30–9am daily | Today's agenda, upcoming events, time-sensitive follow-ups |
| 🌙 **Evening summary** | 7–9pm daily | What was accomplished, what's pending for tomorrow |
| 📅 **Weekly look-ahead** | Sunday 6pm | 7-day horizon: deadlines, events, preparation suggestions |
| 🔍 **Curiosity scan** | Every 6h (waking hours) | Unresolved items, patterns, connections worth surfacing |
| 💡 **Spontaneous interest** | Any scan | Surfaces unexpected observations without being asked |

These drives are defined in `brain/nova_purpose.py` and executed by `brain/attention_engine.py`.

---

## 🔀 Multi-Provider LLM Routing

Nova routes tasks to the right model automatically — balancing speed, cost, and capability.

| Tier | Providers | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| ⚡ **flash** | Gemini 2.0 Flash → Claude Haiku → Grok | Intent classification, simple tools, reminders |
| 🧠 **sonnet** | Claude Sonnet → Gemini Flash → Grok | Conversation, tool execution, research |
| 🎯 **quality** | Claude Sonnet (retry) → Gemini 2.5 Pro | Email drafting, complex composition |
| 💻 **local** | SmolLM2 via Ollama | Offline fallback when all APIs are down |

All provider calls go through **LiteLLM** — one interface, any provider.

---

## 🧠 Memory System

Nova maintains a layered memory architecture backed by **LanceDB** (vector store):

| Memory Type | What's Stored | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 💭 **Working Memory** | Tone, urgency, unfinished items, pending action confirmations | Per session (JSON) |
| 🎬 **Episodic Memory** | Action outcomes — what worked, what failed | Persistent (LanceDB) |
| 💬 **Conversation Memory** | Full history per channel and user | Persistent (LanceDB) |
| ⚙️ **Preferences** | Learned facts about you — style, habits | Persistent (LanceDB) |
| 👥 **Contacts** | People you interact with | Persistent (LanceDB) |
| 🪪 **Identity** | Bot's core identity and principles | Persistent (LanceDB) |

Third-party content (emails from others) is **summarised before storage**, never stored verbatim. Financial and health data is filtered out at ingestion.

---

## 🤖 AGI Capabilities

| Capability | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 🎵 **Tone Analyzer** | `brain/tone_analyzer.py` | Detects 5 tone registers in real-time, zero-latency |
| 💭 **Working Memory** | `brain/working_memory.py` | Tracks momentum, urgency, conversation state, and pending action confirmations |
| 🎬 **Episodic Memory** | `brain/episodic_memory.py` | Records event-outcome pairs; tracks per-tool success rates |
| 🌟 **Purpose** | `brain/nova_purpose.py` | Nova's soul — 5 drives (morning, evening, weekly, curiosity, spontaneous) shape all proactive behavior |
| 👁️ **Attention Engine** | `brain/attention_engine.py` | Purpose-driven proactive observations every 6h (morning brief, evening summary, curiosity scan) |
| 🧩 **Goal Decomposer** | `core/goal_decomposer.py` | Breaks complex goals into 3–7 subtasks with explicit `depends_on` for parallel execution |
| ⚡ **Task Runner** | `core/task_runner.py` | DAG-based parallel execution; notifies Telegram on each step and on completion |
| 🔍 **Critic Agent** | `brain/critic_agent.py` | Validates task output quality (score ≥ 0.75 to pass); triggers one LLM refinement pass if below threshold; fail-open |
| 📚 **Reasoning Templates** | `brain/reasoning_template_library.py` | Stores successful goal→subtask decompositions in LanceDB; GoalDecomposer queries before each new task to reuse proven patterns |
| ✅ **Pending Action Confirmation** | `brain/working_memory.py` + `conversation_manager.py` | Stores proposed actions ("shall I post this?") and executes on user confirmation ("yes") — fixes the re-draft loop |
| 📊 **Intent Collector** | `brain/intent_data_collector.py` | Captures live intent labels as training data for future model fine-tuning |

## 📋 Intelligent Delegation (Google DeepMind Framework)

Nova implements the key principles from the *Intelligent AI Delegation* research paper, giving autonomous background tasks the same trust properties as human-delegated work.

<details>
<summary>View all 10 delegation principles</summary>

| Principle | What's implemented |
|---|---|
| 📝 **Contract-first decomposition** | Every subtask has a `verification_criteria` — a one-sentence success test written before execution begins |
| 🔄 **Reversibility classification** | `reversible: bool` on each subtask; irreversible steps (send email, post to X) show a Telegram warning with a 10-second cancel window |
| 🔀 **Adaptive re-delegation** | When a subtask exhausts all retries, Gemini Flash proposes an alternative approach and tries once more |
| 📊 **Tool performance awareness** | EpisodicMemory tracks per-tool success rates; GoalDecomposer uses this to prefer reliable tools and flag flaky ones |
| ⚡ **Dynamic cognitive friction** | High-risk background tasks surface a risk note in the confirmation message so you're informed before queuing |
| 🗂️ **Delegation audit trail** | Every task produces `{task_id}_audit.json` with per-step metadata: tool used, tokens, success, re-delegated flag |
| 🔑 **Just-in-time tool access** | Each subtask only exposes its declared tools to the agent — a web-search step cannot accidentally call email |
| 🔐 **Continuous authorization** | Task DB status is re-read before every subtask; "stop task" cancels immediately, not just between tasks |
| 🎯 **Multi-dimensional routing** | 4-signal delegation score (tool variety, reversibility, complexity keywords, scope) catches complex tasks the LLM might under-label |
| 💰 **Task budget enforcement** | Hard limits: 200k cumulative tokens or 30 minutes wall time per task; partial results delivered if either is hit |

</details>

---

## ⚡ Parallel Background Execution

When Nova decomposes a background task, it builds a **dependency graph** (not a flat list). Independent steps run concurrently; dependent steps wait for their predecessors.

```
Goal: "Research AI funding trends and write a summary"

GoalDecomposer output:
  Step 0: Search Tavily for AI funding 2025         depends_on: []
  Step 1: Search X for AI funding posts             depends_on: [0]  ┐
  Step 2: Fetch TechCrunch AI funding article       depends_on: [0]  ├─ parallel wave
  Step 3: Fetch Crunchbase AI report                depends_on: [0]  ┘
  Step 4: Compile findings → data/tasks/{id}.txt    depends_on: [1,2,3]

Execution:
  Wave 0: Step 0  (sequential — primes the search)
  Wave 1: Steps 1, 2, 3  (asyncio.gather — run simultaneously)
  Wave 2: Step 4  (waits for all three to finish)
```

Each wave runs via `asyncio.gather()`. Steps 1–3 execute concurrently, cutting wall time roughly 3×.

## 🔒 Security

Nova applies **18 defence layers** to every message.

<details>
<summary>View all 18 security layers</summary>

1. 🚦 Rate limiting per user
2. 🧹 Input sanitization (length, encoding)
3. 🛡️ Prompt injection detection (LLM Security Guard)
4. 🕵️ PII redaction (phone, email, SSN, IBAN, routing numbers)
5. 🏷️ Trust-tier enforcement (owner vs. untrusted callers)
6. 🚧 Policy Gate (read / write / irreversible risk classification)
7. 📬 Durable Outbox (deduplication — no double sends)
8. 🔍 Tool output injection guard
9. ✅ Semantic relevance validation (distance thresholds on all vector searches)
10. 🧽 Output filtering (strip credentials, XML artefacts)
11. 🚫 Bash command blocklist (rm -rf, sudo, reverse shells, encoding bypasses)
12. ⚡ Circuit breaker (3 API failures → 2-minute cooldown)
13. ☠️ Dead Letter Queue (poison events → Telegram alert after 3 retries)
14. 🌐 SSRF protection (blocks private/internal network access from web tools)
15. 📂 Directory confinement (file writes restricted to project root + /tmp)
16. 🔐 Fail-closed channels (WhatsApp/Voice reject all if allow-list not configured)
17. 🔑 Timing-safe auth (HMAC constant-time comparison for API keys)
18. ☢️ Per-user state isolation (no cross-user context leakage)

</details>

Risk and supervision are formally documented in [`RISKS.md`](../RISKS.md) and [`SUPERVISION.md`](../SUPERVISION.md).

pip install -r requirements.txt   # pick up any new dependencies
sudo systemctl restart novabot
```

---

## 🍎 Deployment (Mac / macOS)

No code changes are needed — Nova runs natively on macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel).

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmplifyCo/novabot.git
cd novabot

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Browser support — no extra system packages needed on Mac
playwright install chromium
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env          # fill in your API keys
```

### Run (foreground — for testing)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python src/main.py
```

### Run as a background service (launchd)

`launchd` is the Mac equivalent of `systemd`. It keeps Nova alive across reboots automatically.

**Step 1 — Create a startup wrapper script**

launchd doesn't source `.env` files, so use a small shell script that loads it first:

```bash
cat > ~/novabot/start_nova.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
set -a
source "$(dirname "$0")/.env"
set +a
exec "$(dirname "$0")/venv/bin/python" "$(dirname "$0")/src/main.py"
EOF

chmod +x ~/novabot/start_nova.sh
```

**Step 2 — Create the launchd plist**

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with the output of `whoami` and adjust the path if you cloned elsewhere:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/novabot/logs

cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.nova.digitalclone</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/novabot/start_nova.sh</string>
    </array>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/novabot</string>

    <!-- Start automatically on login -->
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Restart automatically if it crashes -->
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>

    <!-- Wait 10s before restarting after a crash -->
    <key>ThrottleInterval</key>
    <integer>10</integer>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/novabot/logs/nova.log</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/novabot/logs/nova_error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF
```

**Step 3 — Load the service**

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist
```

Nova is now running and will restart automatically on login or if it crashes.

### Mac service cheat sheet

| Task | Mac (launchctl) | Linux (systemctl) |
|---|---|---|
| **Start** | `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist` | `sudo systemctl start novabot` |
| **Stop** | `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist` | `sudo systemctl stop novabot` |
| **Restart** | `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nova.digitalclone` | `sudo systemctl restart novabot` |
| **Status** | `launchctl list \| grep nova` | `sudo systemctl status novabot` |
| **Enable on boot** | `RunAtLoad: true` in plist (already set above) | `sudo systemctl enable novabot` |
| **Logs (live)** | `tail -f ~/novabot/logs/nova.log` | `journalctl -u novabot -f` |

### Update on Mac

```bash
cd ~/novabot
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Restart Nova
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.nova.digitalclone
```

### Uninstall the service

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nova.digitalclone.plist
```

## 🔄 Data Flow Examples

<details>
<summary><b>"Find the top Thai restaurants in Fremont, CA"</b> — inline action</summary>

```
1. Telegram → Heart
   Intent: action | confidence: high | tools: web_search | background: no

2. Heart → Agent (flash tier — single tool, runs inline)

3. Agent → web_search("top Thai restaurants Fremont CA")
   → Tavily returns 5 results with addresses, ratings, summaries

4. Agent synthesises → response to user

5. Heart → store_conversation_turn() → LanceDB
6. Heart → IntentDataCollector.record("Thai restaurants...", "action", 0.9)
   → data/intent_training/samples.jsonl (training data for future fine-tuning)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>"Research AI funding trends and write me a summary"</b> — background task</summary>

```
1. Telegram → Heart
   delegation_score: 0.80 (3 tools + complexity keywords) → background: yes

2. Heart → enqueue background task → "Got it, I'll notify you when done"

3. TaskRunner picks up → GoalDecomposer → 5 subtasks with depends_on graph:
   · Step 0: Initial Tavily search (wave 0)
   · Steps 1,2,3: Fetch 3 articles in parallel (wave 1 — asyncio.gather)
   · Step 4: Compile + write data/tasks/{id}.txt (wave 2)

4. Before each wave: re-check task status (continuous authorization)
   Before irreversible steps: Telegram warning + 10s cancel window

5. TaskRunner completes → reads file → sends full content to Telegram in chunks
6. Audit saved: data/tasks/{id}_audit.json (per-step tokens, timing, success)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>"Draft a tweet about our product launch" → "yes"</b> — pending action confirmation</summary>

```
1. Telegram → Heart
   Intent: action | tools: x_tool | background: no

2. Heart → Agent (sonnet tier — composition + tool)

3. Agent drafts tweet but doesn't post (high-stakes → confirm first)
   → Response: "Here's a draft: '...' — shall I post it?"

4. Heart → _detect_and_store_proposal()
   → Pending action stored in WorkingMemory: {tool: x_tool, label: "post tweet"}

5. User replies: "yes"

6. Heart → _handle_pending_action_confirmation() [EARLY EXIT — skips intent routing]
   → Pops pending action → Agent executes x_tool with stored parameters
   → Response: "Posted! Here's the link: ..."
```
